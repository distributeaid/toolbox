## Up & Running

**Setup Docker**

1. Install Docker - https://docs.docker.com/install/
2. Install Docker Compose - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
3. Start the Docker daemon.
   - MacOS / Windows: Start the Docker application.
   - Linux: follow
     [these post-install steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).
     Especially "managing docker as non-root" and "configure docker to start on
     boot".

See the [_Common Docker Commands_](#common-docker-commands) section below for
more info about how we use Docker.

**Clone The Project**

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:masksfordocs/toolbox.git
cd toolbox/
```

**Run Containers**

- Start: `docker-compose up`
- Stop: `ctrl-c` in the same window, or `docker-compose down` in another

When starting the containers, once you see this message it is ready:

> [info] Running FerryWeb.Endpoint with Cowboy using http://0.0.0.0:1312

See the [_Common Docker Commands_](#common-docker-commands) section below for a
list of container names.

**Run the Front End**

```
$ cd toolbox/react_ui
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Your browser will automatically open the UI.

The `localhost` address is used in the rest of this readme, but the `0.0.0.0`
address should be the same thing.

See the [front-end README](react_ui/README.md) for further info on contributing
to the front end.

**Dev Environment**

You'll need AWS credentials to integrate with Cognito for authentication. Copy
the example config, then update with keys from the AWS console or CLI.

```
cp .env.secret.example .env.secret
```

If you don't have AWS credentials yet, ask someone on the team. Still run the
command above, the app will run without proper creds, but you will not be able
to use authenticated features.

Format your code before committing. In order to do that, please setup a pre commit hook
by doing:

```
$ ln -s -f ../../hooks/pre-commit ./.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Troubleshooting**

If you see that a container has exited with code 127 (e.g. "toolbox_web exited
with code 127"), in your terminal:

- close that container with `ctrl-c`
- run `$ docker-compose build` to ensure you rebuild the service in case its
  Dockerfile or contents of its build directory has changed.
- run `$ docker-compose up` to restart the container.
- in another terminal window, run `$ docker ps -a`, and check that toolbox_web
  image is running on port `0.0.0.0:1312->1312/tcp`. For example:

  ```
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                           NAMES
  086b5fc29e52        toolbox_web         "/bin/sh -c '/app/deâ€¦"   42 minutes ago      Up 32 minutes             0.0.0.0:1312->1312/tcp          toolbox_web
  ```

**_Additional problems_**

- Try not to have PostgreSQL running locally (potential conflict issues).
- Fix incorrect development folder permissions with: `chmod -R +x development/`.

To verify that the seeds ran correctly select all entries in the groups table
(there should be 1). You can do this from PG Admin or the command line. See the
_Managing Dev Databases_ below for how to connect via the command line, then use
the following SELECT statement:

```
SELECT * FROM groups;
```

## API

If everything is running correctly, you should be able to visit
http://localhost:1312/health or http://0.0.0.0:1312/health and see the health
check:

```
[
  {
    db_access: {
      status: "ok"
    },
    time: 1.66
  }
]
```

A GraphQL API is provided at `/api`. The
[Absinthe docs](https://hexdocs.pm/absinthe/overview.html) are a good starting
place to learn more about GraphQL in the context of elixir.

You can use a browser implementation of graphiql to view the schema
documentation and run test queries: http://localhost:1312/api/graphiql

## Common Docker Commands

Docker's commandline documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/

- `docker ps -a` - List containers. Very useful for getting a container's name,
  id, or status. For more information see
  [Docker's ps documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/).
- `docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME $COMMAND` - Execute a command on a container. For
  more information see here
  [Docker's exec documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/).
- `docker exec -it $CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash` - Enter a bash shell on a
  container where you can run multiple mix commands in a row. This is very
  useful for the web container.

Our docker container names are:

- **toolbox_web** - The elixir dev server. All mix commands will be run on this
  container.
- **toolbox_db** - Our dev database. This is the database that you interact with
  from the locally hosted development site.
- **dbtest** - Our test database. `mix test` and `MIX_ENV=test $command` will
  both use this database.
- **dbadmin** - The PG Admin server.

## Common Mix Commands

**Pheonix:**

- https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/phoenix_mix_tasks.html#content
- You can also lookup each individual task in the mix section of the left side
  menu.
- See `/development/web-entrypoint.sh` for common commands that are run when you
  start the containers.

```
# list all routes in the app
docker exec toolbox_web mix phx.routes

# code generation (look these up in the docs- many options)
# NOTE: Don't run code generation tasks through the Docker container.
#       They generated files will have the wrong permissions.
mix phx.gen.schema [OPTIONS]
mix phx.gen.context [OPTIONS]
mix phx.gen.html [OPTIONS]
```

**Ecto:**

- https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Mix.Tasks.Ecto.html (select a specific task in the
  left side menu)

```
docker exec toolbox_web mix ecto.migrate
docker exec toolbox_web mix ecto.rollback -n 1
docker exec toolbox_web mix ecto.reset

docker exec toolbox_web mix ecto.gen.migration "migration name"
```

**Testing:**

- https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Test.html
- https://github.com/parroty/excoveralls#mix-coveralls-show-coverage

```
docker exec toolbox_web mix test --color

# run specific tests- all in a folder, all in a file, or even just a single one
docker exec toolbox_web mix test --color test/$PATH_TO_FOLDER_OR_FILE
docker exec toolbox_web mix test --color test/$PATH:$TEST_LINE_NUMBER

# run tests synchronously, in order
docker exec toolbox_web mix test --color --trace

# for code coverage
docker exec toolbox_web mix coveralls
docker exec --env MIX_ENV=test toolbox_web mix coveralls.html
```

Mix commands can be targeted to the test environment / database by setting an
environment variable `MIX_ENV=test`. There are three ways to do this:

1. Specify an environment variable using docker exec's `--env` flag. EX:
   `docker exec --env MIX_ENV=test toolbox_web mix ecto.reset`
2. Run a shell command which executes another command that starts by setting the
   environment variable. EX:
   `docker exec toolbox_web sh -c "MIX_ENV=test mex ecto.reset`.
3. Finally, you can always open a bash shell on the web container and run the
   commands directly. EX: `docker exec -it toolbox_web /bin/bash` and then
   `MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.reset` in the shell.

**Code Quality**

Format your code before committing. In order to do that, please setup a pre commit hook
by doing:

```
$ ln -s -f ../../hooks/pre-commit ./.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

```
# credo performs static code analysis
docker exec toolbox_web mix credo list

# to learn more about a particular issue in credo
docker exec toolbox_web mix credo explain file/and/linenumber.ex:101

# format a file in the standard elixir style
docker exec toolbox_web mix format "path/to/file.ex"
docker exec toolbox_web mix format "pattern/**/path/*.{ex,exs}"
```

## Managing Dev Databases

**PG Admin:** With the docker containers running, go to http://localhost:8088 in
your browser. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`. You should now
be able to use the PG Admin GUI to manage your local dev databases.

**psql:** If you prefer to use the commandline, you can run psql in the database
docker containers:

```
# dev database
docker exec -it toolbox_db sh -c "psql -U toolbox -d toolbox_dev"

# test database
docker exec -it dbtest sh -c "psql -U toolbox -d toolbox_dev"
```

```

## Generating a database diagram


Ensure that:

* You have Java installed (`brew install openjdk`) 
* A running Postgres
* The following env variables are set: `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_HOST`

Then:

* update your schema: `mix ecto.migrate`
* generate the diagram: `mix db.diagram`

This task will run `Schemaspy` and generate a diagram in PNG format at `docs/db/diagram.png`.

Please don't forget to commit this file to source control.


## Deployment

You must have SSH access to the target environment to perform these steps. Reach
out via Slack if you feel you need to deploy.

Move to the Ansible directory:

```
cd ./ansible
```

Install the Datadog playbook:

```
ansible-galaxy install datadog.datadog
```

Deploy with the following playbook command:

```
ansible-playbook \
  -i aws_ec2.yml \
  -u ec2-user \
  --extra-vars "version={:branch-name-dash-short-hash} env={:env}" \
  --private-key ~/.ssh/{:your-deploy-key} \
  deploy.yml
```
