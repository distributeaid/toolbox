Thanks so much for your interest in contributing to Distribute Aid!  We really appreciate your help.  The foundation of the refugee aid movement is built by everyday folks putting in a few hours every week, and you should be proud to be a part of it.

Through your work with Distribute Aid you will make it easier for hundreds of aid workers on the ground to improve the lives of tens of thousands of newcomers.  But first there are a couple of onboarding steps to get through:

 1. We take a people-first approach at Distribute Aid, and will do our best to match you up with work that fits your skillset and interests.   We like to start with a WhatsApp call or video chat so we can get to know each other properly and figure out what you’ll be doing together.  Please email Taylor at code@distributeaid.org to introduce yourself and provide us with your availability so we can schedule this.

 2. We'll reply to confirm a time, and send you Distribute Aid’s project plan.  It’s a fairly long document that details every facet of our organisation and our plans over the next year or so.  I suggest taking 30 minutes to skim through it before the onboarding call to get a better sense of what Distribute Aid is all about.

 3. If everything sounds good to you, we'll send you our volunteer agreement after the call.  Please sign the last page and send me back a photograph or scanned copy.

 4. Finally- the fun stuff!  We'll set you up on our task manager (Trello), team chat (WhatsApp), add you to our repositories (hosted on GitLab), and introduce you to the team.  I'll also schedule a follow-up call to check in after your first week so I can answer any questions you have about the codebase. 

Again, thanks so much for helping us on this project.  We're on track to save refugee aid groups hundreds of hours and create €270,000 in value for the refugee aid supply chain in 2019!  I look forward to working with you this year to reach those goals.

**TODO:** replace this with something a bit more digestable, as well as quick instructions to report an issue
